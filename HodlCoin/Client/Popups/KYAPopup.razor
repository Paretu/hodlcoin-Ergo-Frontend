        <br /> 
        <MudText Typo="Typo.h6" Style="font-weight: bold;">By accepting this KYA, you agree to the following:</MudText>
        <MudText>1. Any use of this UI and/or interaction with the contracts is at your own risk.</MudText>
        <MudText>2. We cannot guarantee the absence of bugs or errors.</MudText>
        <MudText>3. The hodlCoin game operates on a live blockchain. Transactions are final and irreversible.</MudText>
        <MudText>4. If you lose access to your wallet we cannot offer any assistance.</MudText>
        <MudText>5. You are responsible for keeping your wallet and it's assets safe.</MudText>
        <MudText>6. This UI interacts directly with the bank contract and does not use any proxy boxes. Therefore the amount you see in the sign popup of your wallet is what you will receive.</MudText>
        <MudText>7. Under certain circumstances it is possible the price changed between the time you entered the amount and clicked the mint/burn button. Always double check the amounts in the wallet popup before submitting.</MudText>
        <MudText>8. During busy times it may be possible that you have to retry a few times to get your transaction sent.</MudText>
        <MudText>9. If you prefer you can also use the <MudLink Href="https://phoenixfi.app/">PhoenixFi UI</MudLink> to interact with the hodlCoin game through proxy contracts.</MudText>
